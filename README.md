# LSST_OpSim
This repo contains notebooks and scripts to get started testing LSST Cadence simulations hosted on SciServer at JHU. This work was initiated to encourage LSST AGN SC collegues to develop and run metrics on those cadence simulations. However, we see the end product as something which will potentially benefit everyone working on LSST but doesn't have adquate infrastructures to do so. 

The first step is to create an account on [SciServer](http://www.sciserver.org/), then create a container using the `LSST Simulations` image and mount the Cadence volume to the new container. Detailed instruction are proivded [here].
